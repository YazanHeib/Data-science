# Data Science - Ex 1

This project looks at energy data from different regions to find trends in total energy supply, renewable energy production, and yearly changes. The work includes cleaning the data, converting energy measurements into GWH, and doing calculations like tracking the growth of renewable energy and spotting years with negative trends. The results are shown in charts to highlight how energy use and renewable adoption have changed over time.
