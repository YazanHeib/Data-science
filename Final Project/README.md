# Final Project Data Science
This project analyzed how GDP, daily income, and COâ‚‚ emissions affect life expectancy in the 19th and 20th centuries. We cleaned and merged data, analyzed correlations, and used machine learning (Random Forest) to predict life expectancy. The model's accuracy was improved by selecting important features. The goal was to understand how economic and environmental factors impact life expectancy worldwide.
